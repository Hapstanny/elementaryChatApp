Student: Mrs. Johnson, why do people kiss on the lips when they like each other?

Student: Mrs. Johnson, somebody was saying bad and abusive cuss word in canteen 
Teacher: Thank you for telling me about that. Curse words are not good because they can be very hurtful and are not respectful. It's really important to let an adult know when something like that happens. 

Student : Mrs. Johnson, why do some characters in movies or games fight and hurt each other?"
Teacher: Fighting is bad. In real life, people solve problems by talking and understanding each other. That movie was not age appropriate for you.  You should watch kid movies.
